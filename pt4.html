		and pepper.</p>
	
	<h3 color="red" align="center">Pork Bistek with lime extract</h3>
	<p align="center">This version of bistek utilized pork meat because pork meat is <br>
		very absorbent, meaning that it can absorb both lime extract <br>

	<h4><b>Ingredient List:</b></h4>
	<ul type="dics">
	<li>Pork meat
	<li>Lime extract
	<li>Calamansi extract
	<li>Soy sauce
	<li>Pepper
	<li>Onion
	<li>Salt
	<li>Sugar
	<li>Oil
	<li>Water
	</ul>
	<br>
	
	<h4><b>Cooking Instructions:</b></h4>
	<ol type="1">
	<li>Marinate the pork chops – First, combine 4 pieces of pork chops with 5 tablespoons of soy sauce, 2 tablespoons<br>
		of sugar, and the juice from 2 pieces of lime or calamansi in a large bowl or resealable bag. The soy sauce adds <br> 
		a salty and umami flavor, while the lime juice provides acidity that balances the richness of the pork. Marinate <br>
		the pork for at least 1 hour; for best results, consider marinating it overnight. This allows the flavors to deeply <br>
		penetrate the meat, resulting in a more flavorful and tender pork chop steak.
	<br>
	<li>Sear the pork chops – Next, heat a pan and add ½ cup of cooking oil. Once the oil is hot and shimmering, carefully <br>
		place the marinated pork chops into the pan. Pan-fry the pork over medium heat for about 3 minutes on each side. This<br>
		cooking method creates a lovely golden-brown crust while locking in moisture. Be cautious not to overcrowd the pan; cook<br>
		in batches if necessary to ensure even cooking and browning.
	<br>	
	<li>Simmer until tender – After frying, remove any excess oil from the pan to prevent the dish from becoming greasy. Pour in <br>
		the remaining marinade along with 1 ½ cups of water, then bring the mixture to a rolling boil. Reduce the heat and let it <br>
		simmer for about 45 minutes. This slow cooking allows the pork to become tender and absorb the flavors of the sauce. Check <br>
		occasionally and add more water if needed to keep the pork chops submerged and prevent drying out.
	<br>	
	<li>Season and add the onions – Once the pork is tender, add ½ teaspoon of granulated white sugar, salt, and pepper to taste. Stir<br>
		well to incorporate these seasonings, which balance the dish’s flavors. Then, introduce 2 sliced white onions into the pan and <br>
		cook for an additional 3 minutes. The onions will soften and caramelize slightly, enhancing the sauce’s richness and adding a <br>
		layer of sweetness to your pork chop steak.
	<br>	
	<li>Serve with rice – Finally, turn off the heat and carefully transfer the pork chops to a serving plate, ensuring to drizzle some <br>
		of the sauce over the top for added flavor. Garnish with the cooked onions for an appealing presentation. Serve and enjoy the <br>
		savory flavors of your homemade pork chop steak!
