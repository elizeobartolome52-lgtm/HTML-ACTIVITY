<h3>THE STORY ITSELF</h3>
<pre>
	A long time ago, in a quiet village, there lived a hardworking mother named Aling Rosa. She was known in their village as a loving and diligent woman who always put her daughter, Pinang, first.

Pinang was beautiful and intelligent, but she was stubborn and often lazy when it came to household chores. Being an only child, she grew up spoiled. Whenever her mother asked her to do something, she did not immediately follow and often gave excuses.

One day, while Aling Rosa was doing laundry by the river, she asked Pinang to clean their small hut and prepare food.
“Pinang, please clean the house and cook dinner for us,” she said. But instead of obeying, Pinang played in the yard with her friends.

When Aling Rosa returned, she found the house in a mess. Pots and pans were lying around, and there was no sign that Pinang had done anything at all. Aling Rosa sighed and asked, “Pinang, my child, why didn’t you do what I asked you to?”

Instead of feeling ashamed, Pinang answered back,
“Mother, why should I? You’re always telling me to do so many things!”

Aling Rosa shook her head sadly and said,
“One day, you’ll understand how important these little tasks are.”

Days passed, but Pinang did not change. She always had an excuse whenever her mother asked her to help.

One morning, Aling Rosa woke up feeling very weak. She had a fever and struggled to get out of bed. She called out to Pinang, who was busy playing in the yard.

“Pinang,” Aling Rosa said softly, “I’m not feeling well. Could you please clean the house and prepare breakfast? I need your help.”

Pinang hesitated for a moment, but her laziness won over.
“Why don’t you just rest, Mother? I’ll do it later,” she said.

Aling Rosa, exhausted and heartbroken, couldn’t find the strength to argue.

When evening came, Aling Rosa was starving and feeling worse. She called for Pinang again.

“Pinang, could you make me some porridge? The ingredients are in the kitchen. I just need something warm to eat,” she pleaded.

Instead of helping, Pinang got up and snapped,
“Mother, where’s the pot? Where’s the garlic? Where can I find these things? I don’t want to look for them! Just tell me everything!”

Tears welled up in Aling Rosa’s eyes.
“Pinang, why are you so lazy? Must you depend on me for everything? I wish you had many eyes so you could see everything you’re looking for!”

Overcome with exhaustion and anger, Aling Rosa fell into a deep sleep, her heart heavy with sadness.

The next morning, Aling Rosa woke up to an eerie silence. Pinang was nowhere to be found. She searched everywhere but couldn’t see her daughter. As she walked around the yard, she noticed a strange plant growing in one corner. Its leaves were long and sharp, and its fruit seemed to have many small eyes staring back at her.

Aling Rosa knelt down, her tears flowing freely. She realized what had happened—Pinang had been punished by the heavens. Her daughter had turned into a plant with many eyes, symbolizing her habit of always asking where things were instead of finding them herself.

“Pinang, my child,” Aling Rosa whispered through her tears, “I’m sorry if I failed to teach you better. I love you so much.”

From that day on, Aling Rosa cared for the plant. She named it “Pinang” in memory of her daughter. Over time, “Pinang” became “Pineapple.” Its fruit, covered in tiny eyes, serves as a reminder of the importance of being responsible and helpful.

Even today, the legend of the pineapple continues to teach children and adults alike. Whenever you see a pineapple, remember the story of Pinang and the valuable lesson she left behind: in everything you do, always strive to be responsible and thoughtful.
