<h1>TREE</h1>
<h3>Joyce Kilmer</h3>
<p><span style="color:red;"> I think that I shall never see <br> A poem lovely as a tree. </span></p>
<p><span style="color:blue;"> A tree whose hungry mouth is prest <br> Against the sweet earth's flowing breast;</span></p>
<p><span style="color:yellow;"> A tree that looks at God all day, <br> And lifts her leafy arms to pray; </span></p>
<p><span style="color:pink;"> A tree that may in summer wear <br> A nest of robins in her hair; </span></p>
<p><span style="color:green;"> Upon whose bosom snow has lain; <br> Who intimately lives with rain. </span></p>
<p><span style="color:purple;"> Poems are made by fools like me, <br> But only God can make a tree. </span></p>
